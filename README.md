# 📈 Stock Price Prediction LQ45 Using the GBM Method with Monte Carlo Simulation – R Shiny App

🔗 **Live App**: [GBM Monte Carlo Saham – LQ45](https://zahraulayasifa.shinyapps.io/GBMMonteCarloSaham/)

A **GUI-based R Shiny application** for analyzing **stock price predictions** in the **LQ45 index** using the **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** method, which models stochastic price movements with randomness captured through **Monte Carlo simulation**.

## 🔍 Overview
This application is designed to assist users—especially investors or analysts—in making **informed investment decisions** for stocks they plan to buy or currently hold, based on probabilistic modeling and statistical validation.

## ✨ Key Features
- 📊 **Stock price simulation** using GBM with Monte Carlo
- 📈 **Normality testing** of return data
- 🧮 **Model evaluation metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- 📋 **Comprehensive tables and plots** for:
  - Historical stock data
  - Simulated future price paths
  - Prediction vs. actual price comparisons

## 🎯 Purpose
This app helps users:
- Understand how stock prices may evolve stochastically over time
- Simulate future price scenarios under uncertainty
- Make data-driven investment decisions based on simulation and model performance
